poems are like french fries
we lives, we loves we lies
these words make me cries
i guess ethan cannot rhyme
ethans singing should be a crime
I would say its quite fine
But alas we must now go
so now lets give them a show
and we'll have you know
this poem is a new low
by Dante Zambelli, Bryce Parker, and Ethan Ucar
